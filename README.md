# A-Kata-A-Day

Thank you to @varunu28 for the inspiration to do something similar!

I have taken up the challenge to solve 1 Kata everyday from CodeWars. I will be storing the solutions for the problems I solve here and I aim to solve at least 1 Kata everyday (in the lanugages I use the most Python, Javascript, Java).

### Programming languages used to solve the Kata


|    Programming Language  |    Kata Count  | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| [JAVA](https://github.com/jguardado39/A-Kata-A-Day/tree/master/Java) | 9 | 
| [Python](https://github.com/jguardado39/A-Kata-A-Day/tree/master/Python) | 68 | 
| [JavaScript](https://github.com/jguardado39/A-Kata-A-Day/tree/master/JavaScript) | 22 |
